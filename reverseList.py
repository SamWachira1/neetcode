# Reverse a Linked List
# Solved 
# Given the beginning of a singly linked list head, reverse the list, and return the new beginning of the list.

# Example 1:

# Input: head = [0,1,2,3]

# Output: [3,2,1,0]
# Example 2:

# Input: head = []

# Output: []

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):

class Solution:

        prev = None 
        curr = head
        while curr:
            temp = curr.next 
            curr.next = prev 
            prev = curr 
            curr = temp
